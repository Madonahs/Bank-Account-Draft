
## Contributing
For contributors: We create new issues and fix them and use:

`git commit -m "fixed #issue number"`

We will create new branches instead of pushing to the master directly; Once a branch is accepted to the master we can close the branch and start a new one. :) 

For new Members When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change via issues sections so that the contributors can see what you want to add in.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

Happy Learning.
